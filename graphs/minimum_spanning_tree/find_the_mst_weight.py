# Find The MST Weight

"""
1. In spanningTreePrimAlgorithm:
   - A min-heap (priority queue) is used to always pick the edge with the least weight.
   - An array "visited" keeps track of vertices already in the MST.
   - Starting from vertex 0, we push its neighbors into the heap.
   - We then extract the smallest edge that connects to an unvisited vertex, add its weight, mark the vertex as visited, and push its unvisited neighbors.
   - The process continues until all vertices are included.

2. In spanningTreeKruskalAlgorithm:
   - We first convert the adjacency list into an edge list and eliminate duplicate edges by only considering edges when u < v.
   - The edges are sorted by weight.
   - A union-find (DSU) structure is used to check for cycles while adding edges.
   - The smallest edge is added if it connects two different trees (using union-find). This continues until the MST has V - 1 edges.
